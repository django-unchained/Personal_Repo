#Mapping from interval to its SEMI TONE offset from the root
#Taking care of intervals above 7 must be handled in code by
#converting to one of these intervals. The +/- remains, but
#the interval value will change accordingly
#Also, the direction must be inferred from the sign. For ex.
#1- -> 11, but it really is -1, leading to the lower octave.
#PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER MAP FROM No. of Semi-tones -> Name of interval
1  -> 0
2  -> 2
3  -> 4
4  -> 5
5  -> 7
6  -> 9
7  -> 11
8  -> 12
